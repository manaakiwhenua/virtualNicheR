Description: The ability to generate virtual niches enables virtual ecology 
    experiments that have been advocated for evaluating species-environment 
    relationship models. Using multivariate normal distributions and matrix 
    algebra this package provides a unique computational framework to generate 
    integrated fundamental and realised niches, which is important given 
    differences in possible complexity of realised niche shapes that result 
    from biotic interactions.
